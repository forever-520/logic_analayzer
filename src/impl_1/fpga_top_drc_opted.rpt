REQP-1840#1 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 u_sample_buffer/ram_reg has an input control pin u_sample_buffer/ram_reg/ADDRARDADDR[10] (net: u_sample_buffer/wr_addr[7]) which is driven by a register (u_la_core/wr_addr_reg[7]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>
